Repo for single .py script called by Johnson and Sasson's decomposition web app (bam.bi.no/decomposeConstraint).

The .py script ingests a Python networkx graph, decomposes constraint, and returns a networkx graph with constraint's 7 terms plus a covariance matrix. These are available for viewing and download via the web app.  

The .csv file is an edgelist sampled from Burt's industry data. This edgelist can be used to test the web using generalConstraintDecomp for processing.
