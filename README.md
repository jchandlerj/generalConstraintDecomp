Repo for single .py script called by Johnson and Sasson's decomposition web app (bam.bi.no/decomposeConstraint).

The .py script ingests a Python networkx graph, decomposes constraint, and returns a networkx graph with constraint's 7 terms plus a covariance matrix. These are available for viewing and download via the web app.
